The International Diabetes Federation[40] consensus worldwide definition of the metabolic syndrome (2006) is:

waistcircumference

Waist circumference (WC) 

 Central obesity (defined as waist circumference# with ethnicity-specific values) AND any two of the following:

Raised triglycerides: > 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality

triglyceridemgdl
HDLcholesterolmgdl

Reduced HDL cholesterol: < 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in males, < 50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) in females, or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality


Bloodpressurefirstsystolic

 or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension


Raised blood pressure (BP): systolic BP > 130 or diastolic BP >85 mm Hg, or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension
Raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG): >100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes

If FPG is >5.6 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL, an oral glucose tolerance test is strongly recommended, but is not necessary to define presence of the syndrome. 



BMI
Central obesity: waist:hip ratio > 0.90 (male); > 0.85 (female), or body mass index > 30 kg/m2



# If BMI is >30 kg/m², central obesity can be assumed and waist circumference does not need to be measured
